# workflows
This is a collection of my public Alfred Workflows.

## Requirements: 
 - macOs with [Alfred 4.+](https://www.alfredapp.com)
 - Some of them use Python3

## The Workflows

 - **frontmostdoc** : Show frontmost document's file of frontmost application in Alfred File Action.
I build this Workflow to launch Alfred File Action by keyword or keyboard shortcut. This is lot faster than hovering the mouse to the top of a window and do ctrl-click the proxy icon. [See more…](frontmostdoc.md)
 - **unmountDisk** : Alfred workflow to help ejecting devices with multiple volumes. [See more…](unmountDisk.md)
