# gosafari: Safari tabgroups implemented as workflow

This workflow let you open group of URLs in Tabs in new Safari window.

## Tab Group Files
Each group is represented by a tab group file, a txt-file with the urls in separate lines. Line which starts with # or > is used as title of the group: 

 * __#__ marks it for private browsing, 
 * __>__ marks for normal browsing.

Other lines not starting with 'http' are ignored.

If the tab group file does not contain any url, a new empty safari window will be created.
 
The txt-files are searched in URLDIR (relative to  your HOME directory or absolute path). There you create your own tab groups.

The tab group files are simple txt-files and are editable with any text editor.

You can generate a tab group file by opening some tabs in a Safari window, start this workflow and select any entry with modifier âŒ˜.


### Sample tab group file:
````
# Visit Alfred
https://www.alfredapp.com/help/
https://www.alfredforum.com
this line is ignored, because it does not start with http
````


## Installation

The Applescript in this workflow uses keystroke from System Events to start a new window in Safari.
