Show external devices connected to your Mac and unmount selected physical disk with 
```
     diskutil unmountDisk
```
Using modifier key ‚åò (cmd) will issue

```
     diskutil unmountDisk force 
```

This workflow was created to overcome some shortcomings with Alfred's system command _Eject_, which today does not handle well drives with multiple partitions and snapshots in APFS containers, e.g. time machine volumes with Big Sur.

You can place icon files into directory $ICONDIR to be placed before a device.
Name of icon file is <volumename>.png and $ICONDIR is relative to your home directory, that is ICONDIR=Pictures/icons will point to /Users/userid/Pictures/icons.

If no icon file exits, a default icon üíæ will be used. If there are mutliple partions in the disk, the first icon file found from the disk's volume names will be taken.
