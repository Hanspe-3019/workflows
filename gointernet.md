# gointernet: Safari tabgroups implemented as workflow

Open group of URLs in Tabs in new Safari private browsing window

Each group is represented by a txt-file with the urls in separate lines. Last line which starts with # or > is used as title of the group: 
	# marks it for private browsing, 
	> marks for normal browsing.

Other lines not starting with 'http' are ignored.

The txt-files are searched 
 1. in URLDIR (relative to $HOME or absolute path)
 2. in Workflow-dir 

## Installation
[Go here and hit Download](gointernet.alfredworkflow), then open the file at your mac to install.
